# rsa-encryption

A C++ based encryption service using RSA encryption

## RSA Algorithm

RSA is an asymmetric cryptographic algorithm used to encrypt and decrypt messages. It uses a pair of keys (private and public) to cipher and decipher messages. The public key can be accessed by anyone whereas the private key is kept secret. The algorithm relies on the fact that finding prime factors of large numbers takes a very long time.

## Program

In this program, users can enter their information which will be encrypted and stored in a file. To be able access their private data, their credentials will be verified and then the file will be decrypted.
